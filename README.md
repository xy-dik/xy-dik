### Hi There! It's Good To See You! 👋

## Hello! It's me, Dika!

- 🔭 I’m currently studying at Information Engineering Bachelor Degree
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UI/UX Design and Front-End Webdev
- 💬 Ask me about design, crime novels, and another random stuff
- 🎲 My fav quote is "_Hakuna Matata_" which means "No Worries"  
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you put text "fun fact" in the first sentences,  
     people will read all of your text and still searching what is  
     fun about this. Don't you?
- 📫 Hit me up at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramudya-kusuma-hardika-284b481b7/) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/xydik_)

Thanks!  
Have a nice day!
